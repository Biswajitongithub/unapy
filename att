Key Takeaways

Increase 100% saturation
________________________
Everyone already has a cell phone.  "500% Saturation."


Increase revenue
________________

Specifically through applications and interoperability.


Decrease health costs

They spent $6B on internal health costs, with revenue of
$12B.  Looking to decrease by *any* measurable amount.


Response
--------
Their main objectives are fairly well aligned, but may
need a little engagement to make it clear.

On 100% saturation, we are completely in agreement.
Access to ubiquitous network connectivity has some serious
advantages.

We foresee adapting a good portion of all existing meters
in active use.  I'm not sure how many, but 50% seems like
a reasonable random guess.

We also foresee re-using this technique on all sorts of
other devices.  Ranging from blood pressure monitors to
pedometers.

The application here consists of a network of
cloud-controllers, delegating access to resources,
updating resources, and managing internal data structures.
On the edge of the cloud are UI channels, including social
integration with facebook, twitter, tudiabetes, technical
channels for integration with google, indivo, etc.
channels including applications like glucosurfer.  On a
different hemisphere of the cloud there are channels for
data and control messages between the data warehouses in
the cloud with the logic that controls them and the
devices and *other legitimate cloud controllers*.
