Forward New Test Results
========================

When a test result is written to the meter's serial port, forward the result
to a server.  

Storing the result in Ram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * store the result in RAM

then
,,,,

  * run TCPATRUN in client mode
  * write the result from RAM into the socket

or
,,,,

  * run TCPATRUN in client mode
  * write the result from RAM into the socket

or
,,

  * socket dial the server and write the result
    The Easy IP guide has a better writeup on this than the TCPATRUN app note.

  * email a special user
  * sms a special message
  * ftp a file


Port forward the meter
======================

An SMSATRUN configuration can tell the module to configure a socket to the
meter.  IP Guide has a nice write up on this kind of thing.  I'm not sure
TCPATRUN is needed, althought SMSATRUN is in the same guide.

DONE.

MongoDB:  http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/SQL+to+Mongo+Mapping+Chart
JSONa/javascript implementation binary , custom BSJON backend
Highly recommended by some Steve Cohen (friend).
python, 
Used by craigslist, foursquare, et al.


Redis:
http://redis.io/documentation
Supports pub/sub natively.
Cliff (boss) tried this and likes it.
Robust mature and recommended libraries for python and ruby.
I like this because subscriptions can be used to handle things asynchronously.
http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/where_redis_is_a_good_fit
Also used by github, craigslist, digg, ...
Perhaps agents check into these while workers subscribe to incoming data stream
and store it persistently.
This is really only good for a consistent view of shared memory, and supports
event driven handling via pub/sub but without a good backend data store.
