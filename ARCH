When a test result is written to the meter's serial port, forward the result
to a server.  

Storing the result in Ram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * store the result in RAM

then
,,,,

  * run TCPATRUN in client mode
  * write the result from RAM into the socket

or
,,,,

  * run TCPATRUN in client mode
  * write the result from RAM into the socket

or
,,

  * socket dial the server and write the result
    The Easy IP guide has a better writeup on this than the TCPATRUN app note.

  * email a special user
  * sms a special message
  * ftp a file


Port forward the meter
======================

An SMSATRUN configuration can tell the module to configure a socket to the
meter.  IP Guide has a nice write up on this kind of thing.  I'm not sure
TCPATRUN is needed, althought SMSATRUN is in the same guide.
