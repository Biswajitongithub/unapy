Hello World: Telit GE865
########################

Objective
~~~~~~~~~

Set up a series of hello world experiments.

  * connecting to the device from an IP based system




Requirements 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * set up service
  * activate correct contexts
  * set up socket
  * configure firewall on device
  * setup TCPATRUN

Can this be done through TCPATRUN?  I don't think so:::

    // can be done via SMSATRUN or otherwise locally
    AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","myAPN"
    AT#SFCG=1,1,1500,0,600,50 // set Inactivity Timeout to 0

Once the device is ready for TCPATRUN, do we device is client or in server
mode?  If the device is in client mode, do we want some kind of hello ack to
aid in discovery?  Should we make a few custom AT commands for TWI?
If the device is in server mode, how do we discover the device's IP?

Can we charge through a usb cable to a known power supply?


Telit Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
code:

    // set up client mode
    AT#SGACTCFG=1,1
    AT#SGACT=1,1
    AT#TCPATRUNCFG=1,2,1024

    AT#TCPATRUND=1
    // DATA set up?
    AT#MON1=7
    AT#MON1
    // data...
    +++ // disconnect?
